# canvas mindmap keyboard
## Introduce
The purpose is to create a canvas-based mind map plug-in that can be operated by keyboard as much as possible.
## Development background
Thank you for this warehouse: [https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Canvas-MindMap](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Canvas-MindMap)

To be honest, if the author of this warehouse hadn't updated the plug-in for 1 year, I wouldn't have been too lazy to develop this plug-in.
